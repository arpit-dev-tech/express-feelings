      <h5>"My Love, From the moment I heard your voice I felt a connection to your soul. I can still remember exactly how you looked the day i saw your photo. Your beautiful eyes captured my heart and your smile erased any and all doubts that I had ever experienced. i want to be wrapped around your arms and never let you go , talking to you feelins like I am 'home' right where I had always belonged. my words are never enough when it comes to you , I realized that I had found my future, my soul-mate and the love that I had always dreamed of discovering. We spoke for hours about every possible subject and never ran out of words to say to each other. I could see the longing and passion in your eyes and I am sure that it was a reflection of the incredibly intense desire that I was feeling at the same moment. The world had ceased to exist and there were only the two of us sitting next to each other, holding hands and experiencing emotions that we had never felt before. When you first whispered the words, 'I love you,' into my ear, it was the happiest moment in my life. My joy was deeper, richer and more intense than I had ever dreamed possible. I can remember the tears in my eyes as I turned to look at you. The kiss we shared on calls and vns I shall never forget. Having to tell you 'Good Night' and put the phone without you was the hardest thing that I have ever had to do in my life. Even knowing that you would text me on the phone later to wish me goodnight once more made our parting no easier to bear. The moments when we were apart seemed like a bitter eternity and I could barely wait until the next time I would call you or talk to you for hours. Never have distances seemed so long and cold and lonely. Our phone conversations would often have long moments where the two of us just held the phone to our ears and took comfort from the sound of the other's soft breathing. You are the only person that could cause my heart to skip a beat with just a sidelong glance or a gentle smile. I gaze into your eyes and lose track of where I am, and even who I am. Your voice stirs a deeply intense longing in every fiber of my body and your careness makes me feel as though I am melting inside. These are feelings that I never knew existed and now I never want to lose these feelings, not even for a moment. Ever since you came into my life I have known what true love and desire really are and these are emotions that many people will never know. You appear to me in my dreams and even these imaginary kisses rock my world and thrill me to the very core of my being. I can barely wait until the night is here, when I can lie in bed and dream of you once more. I want nothing more than to spend my life with you at my side tho ik but... . When I wake in the morning I want to find you there beside me. When I go to sleep at night I want to feel your arms holding me, protecting me from the world. one true love of my life and I am only sorry that it took us so many years to meet. Now that we have found each other and are making a life together I will never again know the empty feelings of loneliness until... . You have made my life complete and I shall cherish your incredible gift of unconditional love and devotion until the moment that my body takes its last breath on this Earth. I love you, my darling. No matter what the future holds for us I will love you until the end of time, and beyond. These words are my promise to never take you for granted or doubt the love that binds us for now and all eternity.     ILY'</h5>
     <p>"Dear Sanchi,  I wanna Say Something.Every passing day without you feels like a piece of me is missing. Your laughter, your kindness, your unwavering support—these are the things I find myself craving more than ever. Life seems a little less colorful without your presence by my side. There's a void in my heart that only you can fill. I hold dearer feelings than words can express.I miss our late-night conversations sometimes, where we bared our souls and shared our dreams without reservation. There's a unique comfort in being able to be completely yourself with someone, and that's a comfort I find only in you.Let's make a promise to each other—to never let the miles between us dull the spark of our relationship. just wanna hug you tigheter to laugh until our stomachs ache and create new memories that will last a lifetime. Until then, I'll hold onto the memories we've made and keep you close in my thoughts and prayers .With each passing day, my anticipation grows stronger, knowing that soon we'll be able to wrap each other in tight hugs. Until that moment arrives, know that you are dearly missed everyday every second and loved more than words can convey. i love you till from the bottom of my heart core and i am really very sorry i think i behaved rude and replied you dry i don't want to hurt you by any mean please forgive me     ....................  .";</p>
