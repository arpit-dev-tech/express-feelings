      <p>"Dear Sanchi,  I wanna Say Something.Every passing day without you feels like a piece of me is missing. Your laughter, your kindness, your unwavering support—these are the things I find myself craving more than ever. Life seems a little less colorful without your presence by my side. There's a void in my heart that only you can fill. I hold dearer feelings than words can express.I miss our late-night conversations sometimes, where we bared our souls and shared our dreams without reservation. There's a unique comfort in being able to be completely yourself with someone, and that's a comfort I find only in you.Let's make a promise to each other—to never let the miles between us dull the spark of our relationship. just wanna hug you tigheter to laugh until our stomachs ache and create new memories that will last a lifetime. Until then, I'll hold onto the memories we've made and keep you close in my thoughts and prayers .With each passing day, my anticipation grows stronger, knowing that soon we'll be able to wrap each other in tight hugs. Until that moment arrives, know that you are dearly missed everyday every second and loved more than words can convey. i love you till from the bottom of my heart core and i am really very sorry i think i behaved rude and replied you dry i don't want to hurt you by any mean please forgive me     ....................  .";</p>
